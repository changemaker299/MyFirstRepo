So far, the most important concept I've learned is the fundamental Git workflow:
Clone, Edit, Stage, Commit, and Push. Understanding the difference between the working directory,
the staging area, and the local repository (through the Git objects) is crucial for managing changes 
efficiently and ensuring only intentional modifications are included in a commit snapshot
